# SmartServicePortal

## Project Description

This project is an online platform offering a wide range of services, such as plumbing, carpentry, electrical work, or general repairs. Each service is categorized, making it easy for users to find and book the service they need. After selecting a service, users can book it directly through the platform, and a service provider will contact them to complete the task. Additionally, users can leave reviews and ratings after the service is completed, helping future users make informed decisions.

The platform streamlines the process of connecting users with reliable professionals for various types of services, providing a seamless experience for both users and service providers.

## Technologies Used

The platform was developed using the following technologies to ensure scalability, performance, and user-friendliness:

- **ASP.NET Domain**: For building the back-end API and handling requests between users and providers efficiently.
- **Entity Framework Domain**: For managing data and database interactions, especially for handling service categories, user reviews, and bookings.
- **ASP.NET Identity & JWT**: To implement authentication and authorization securely using token-based authentication.
- **Onion Architecture**: Used to enforce a clean separation of concerns, ensuring the Domain logic is independent of external dependencies, making the system more maintainable and scalable.
- **Repository Pattern & Unit of Work**: Applied to abstract data access and maintain transactional consistency, making the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.
- **Specification Pattern**: Used to enable flexible and customizable queries, giving the system the capability to handle complex filtering and retrieval operations.
- **Result Pattern**: Implemented to handle errors without relying on exceptions, improving performance by reducing the overhead associated with exception handling.

## Challenges Faced

One of the main challenges was ensuring smooth communication between users and providers while maintaining service quality. Implementing efficient worker availability and service booking management required careful planning to handle real-time requests and track job statuses.

## Future Features

- **Employee and Role Management**: Allow service providers (like companies) to manage employees and assign specific roles or areas of responsibility.
- **Worker Accounts**: Provide workers (e.g., plumbers) with accounts where they can receive job assignments and track the services they need to complete.
- **Job Tracking and Status Updates**: Workers will be able to update job statuses in real-time, providing transparency for both the provider and the user.
- **Advanced Analytics and Reporting**: Enable providers to access detailed reports on booking trends, employee performance, and customer satisfaction.
- **Mobile App**: Expand platform accessibility by offering a mobile app for both users and providers.
